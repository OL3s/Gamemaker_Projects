# ðŸ›  Technical Documentation

## Core Room Structure

Room transitions are handled by direct calls to `room_goto()` in menu actions (no central controller object).

**Main Rooms:**
- `rom_start`: Main menu (continue, new run, tutorial)
- `rom_nextFloor`: Main navigation and menu (store, equipment, home, abilities, missions)
- `rom_dungeon`: Dungeon gameplay
- `rom_boss`: Boss encounter to collect one of the three legendary gems, based on boss type
- `rom_end`: Game over screen (after collecting a gem)
- `rom_tutorial`: Tutorial

## Touch System

- Multi-touch support via `obj_touch_split` object
- Touch areas defined in code for UI and controls

Menu interaction uses `global.service_touch_several` for:
- Multi-touch area detection
- Tap gesture recognition
- UI boundary checking

## Start Screen
- The start screen is displayed in the `rom_start` room.
- Shows the game logo and three gem icons representing collected legendary gems.
- Gems are stored in `components` array, with each gem represented as a struct containing:
  - `image_index`: (number) Sprite frame index for the gem icon
  - `obtained`: (boolean) Whether the gem has been collected
  - `type`: (string) Always `"gem"`
  - `text`: (string, optional) Label such as "continue" or "new run"
- Touch input:
  - **Tap:** Starts or continues a run (`room_goto(rom_nextFloor)`)
  - **Hold:** Opens the tutorial (`room_goto(rom_tutorial)`)
- Uses `obj_start` to handle input and display logic.

## Menu System

Managed by `obj_menu`, providing navigation between screens using a state-based system with touch input.

### Menu Structure

- **Bottom Navigation `gui_bottom` array, (`menu_index`):**
  - **Market (0):** Buy and sell gear, weapons, and consumables
  - **Loadout (1):** Manage and equip your weapons and armor
  - **Home (2):** Return to the Home screen
  - **Skills (3):** Assign and upgrade character abilities
  - **Contracts (4):** Select and review missions for your run

- **Top Status Bar (`gui_top` array):**
  - Gold display (uses `spr_menu_icon_gold`)
  - Secondary resource (placeholder)

### Menu States

- **default:** Main menu view (item/contract lists)
- **selected:** Item/contract details, Contract confirmation.

Menus create touch areas with `create_area()` for responsive UI across screen sizes.

### Market (0)
- Displays items for sale in the array `data_shop` generated by [`global.service_item`](../Mobile_Project/scripts/service_item/service_item.yy)
- Allows players to view item details and purchase gear, weapons, and consumables
- Item selection and purchase actions are handled via touch input and the menu state

### Loadout (1)
- Manage and equip your weapons and armor (2 active equipment slots available for touch selection)
- View and compare gear stats
- Select and equip items using touch input; menu state updates to reflect equipped gear

### Home (2)
- Return to the Home screen

### Skills (3)
- Assign and upgrade character abilities

### Contracts (4)
- Allows players to select up to 3 contracts per run
- Missions are defined in the `data_contracts` array, generated by `global.service_filemanager`
- Each contract is stored in a struct with the following properties:
  - `name`: (string) Mission name
  - `description`: (string) Mission details
  - `reward`: (string) Reward for completing the mission
  - `difficulty`: (number) Difficulty level
  - `type`: (string) Type of mission (e.g., "kill", "collect")
- Shows mission details, sidequests, and rewards
